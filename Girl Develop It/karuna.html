     <p>Starting with the higher resolution is my preferred way to design apps for Apple devices, as it allows me to set the appearance of each single pixel, and add details which won't be visible on the scaled-down version. In the worst case, if you have to use bitmap textures for some reason, the scaled-down version will look a lot better than a scaled-up one (which have blurry textures).</p>
     <p>When designing in 2x resolution, you have to think about what you're doing. For example, you have to avoid sizes like 3 or 5 pixels for border widths, and the same applies to effects like drop shadows - a scaled-down blur ratio of 5 pixels would result in 2 or 3 px blur, and neither would be the result you want to achieve when aiming for real perfection.</p>
     <p>I have seen other designers doing it the other way: starting with the normal size, and scaling the whole design up when it is done. Either way is absolutely fine - I think it always depends on the designer's personal preference. However, in this article I will only describe the way to start with the 2x resolution graphics first.</p>
